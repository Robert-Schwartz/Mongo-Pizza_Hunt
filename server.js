/*
mongoose.connect() tells Mongoose which database we want to connect to. If the environment variable MONGODB_URI exists, like on Heroku when we deploy later, it will use that. Otherwise, it will short-circuit to the local MongoDB server's database at mongodb://localhost/pizza-hunt. The second argument in the example is a set of configuration options Mongoose asks for more information about. */
